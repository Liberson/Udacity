# Project Specification

## Article to Mockup

Goal : Matching the Mockup

Criteria :
1. Text Formatting

    All text is formatted identically to the mockup. 

    You should not use break (< br >) tags for this project. 
  
    You can create the desired separate with paragraph tags (< p >).

2. Image and Link

    The image’s source is the correct URL and the link in the article is correct.

## Reflections

The reflection answers at least three of the four questions:

    What new skills have you learned?
    What has been easy?
    What has been difficult?
    How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Answers can be simple. For instance, if nothing has been easy, you can simply say “Nothing has been easy.”

Grammar, spelling and punctuation do not need to be perfect, but your reflection needs to be understandable.

Bullet points / lists are acceptable.

Any language is acceptable.
